# Unreal GAS Base Project

This repository provides a base Unreal Engine project with the **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)** already implemented in C++.  
It is intended to serve as a starting point for new projects that require GAS, avoiding the need to re-implement the core setup each time.

## ⚠️ Current Status

The GAS integration is **still in progress**. While some of the foundational code is in place, the implementation is not yet complete.  
This repository will be updated once the system is fully functional.

## Purpose

Setting up GAS correctly in Unreal Engine can be time-consuming and repetitive.  
This project provides a reusable base with the necessary modules and structure already set up, so you can focus on building gameplay features rather than boilerplate code.

## Reference

To understand how GAS works in detail, and to follow best practices, refer to the official community documentation:

[https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation)

This documentation is highly recommended whether you are new to GAS or looking to deepen your understanding.

## Features (Planned or In Progress)

- Basic GAS module setup in C++
- Ability System Component (ASC) integration
- Attribute Sets with example attributes
- Example Gameplay Abilities
- Blueprint-ready GAS structure
- Clear folder and class organization following GAS best practices

## Requirements

- Unreal Engine 5.x (this project was started with UE version 5.4.4)
- Visual Studio or Rider (for compiling C++ code)
